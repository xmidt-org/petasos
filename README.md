## Summary
Petasos is the HTTP redirector component of [XMiDT](https://xmidt.io/).
Petasos will redirect http requests to a [talaria](https://github.com/xmidt-org/talaria)
depending on the the device id and talaria service discovery configuration.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [XMiDT Code Of Conduct](https://xmidt.io/code_of_conduct/). 
By participating, you agree to this Code.

## Details
Petasos has one function: to redirect incoming requests to the correct talaria.
The two types of requests are from a device looking to connect to talaria and from scytale looking to forward a request to a device.
In either case, petasos returns an http 307 redirect to the talaria.
Petasos determines the correct talaria via service discovery configuration.
Currently, petasos can be configured either to dynamically coordinate talarias via Consul (`consul` option)
or be statically configured (`fixed` option). Refer to [cluster configuration](https://xmidt.io/docs/operating/getting_started/)
for more information.

Any URI paths (e.g. `/api/v2/device`, `/api/v2/device/send`) will be redirected
to the talaria; petasos doesn't parse or validate the path in the request.
In order for petasos to complete the request, the `X-Webpa-Device-Name` header must
be included.

For example, a docker container running with a fixed configuration will produce the following:
```
$ curl -i  -H "X-Webpa-Device-Name:mac:112233445566" localhost:6400/

## Build

### Source

In order to build from the source, you need a working Go environment with
version 1.11 or greater. Find more information on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

You can directly use `go get` to put the petasos binary into your `GOPATH`:
```bash
GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/xmidt-org/petasos
```

You can also clone the repository yourself and build using make:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
git clone git@github.com:xmidt-org/petasos.git
cd petasos
make build
```

### Makefile

The Makefile has the following options you may find helpful:
* `make build`: builds the petasos binary
* `make docker`: builds a docker image for petasos, making sure to get all
   dependencies
* `make local-docker`: builds a docker image for petasos with the assumption
   that the dependencies can be found already
* `make test`: runs unit tests with coverage for petasos
* `make clean`: deletes previously-built binaries and object files

### RPM

First have a local clone of the source and go into the root directory of the 
repository.  Then use rpkg to build the rpm:
```bash
rpkg srpm --spec <repo location>/<spec file location in repo>
rpkg -C <repo location>/.config/rpkg.conf sources --outdir <repo location>'
```

### Docker

The docker image can be built either with the Makefile or by running a docker
command.  Either option requires first getting the source code.

See [Makefile](#Makefile) on specifics of how to build the image that way.

For running a command, either you can run `docker build` after getting all
dependencies, or make the command fetch the dependencies.  If you don't want to
get the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t petasos:local -f deploy/Dockerfile .
```
If you want to get the dependencies then build, run the following commands:
```bash
GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor
docker build -t petasos:local -f deploy/Dockerfile.local .
```

For either command, if you want the tag to be a version instead of `local`,
then replace `local` in the `docker build` command.

### Kubernetes

A helm chart can be used to deploy petasos to kubernetes
```
helm install xmidt-petasos deploy/helm/petasos
```

## Deploy

For deploying a XMiDT cluster refer to [getting started](https://xmidt.io/docs/operating/getting_started/).

For running locally, ensure you have the binary [built](#Source).  If it's in
your `GOPATH`, run:
```
petasos
```
If the binary is in your current folder, run:
```
./petasos
```
